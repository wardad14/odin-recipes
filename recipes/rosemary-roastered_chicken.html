    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

      <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>

      <li>salt, plus more to taste</li>

      <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>

      <li>5 medium apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>

      <li>1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

      <li>6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>

      <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the top and
        bottom parts of a broiler pan with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add orzo into the casserole dish. Pour in chicken broth. Add spinach
        artichoke dip, minced garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes; stir to
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and Italian seasoning. Add chicken to the
        casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until orzo is tender with a bite, and chicken
        is no longer pink at the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted near the center of chicken should read at least 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove casserole from the oven, uncover, and sprinkle evenly with panko,
        mozzarella cheese, and bagel seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler. Broil casserole until topping is golden, about 5
        minutes. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
