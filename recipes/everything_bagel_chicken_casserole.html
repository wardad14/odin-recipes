    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These smoked jalapeno poppers go great with brisket. If you've never had
      smoked cream cheese before, you are in for a treat. I prefer to use oak or
      hickory in the smoker for these, but feel free to use any wood you like.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup orzo pasta</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup spinach artichoke dip, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken, cubed</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 12x8-inch
        casserole dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add orzo into the casserole dish. Pour in chicken broth. Add spinach
        artichoke dip, minced garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes; stir to
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and Italian seasoning. Add chicken to the
        casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until orzo is tender with a bite, and chicken
        is no longer pink at the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted near the center of chicken should read at least 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove casserole from the oven, uncover, and sprinkle evenly with panko,
        mozzarella cheese, and bagel seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler. Broil casserole until topping is golden, about 5
        minutes. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
